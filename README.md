## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

You can install STRCT using pip:

```bash
pip install strct-tool
```

### Usage

After installation, you can use STRCT from the command line:

1. Create a new project structure:
   ```
   strct <structure_type> [destination_path]
   ```

2. List available templates:
   ```
   strct list
   ```

3. Add a new template:
   ```
   strct add <template_name> <source_path>
   ```

4. Delete a template:

## 📚 Detailed Usage

### Creating a Project Structure

To create a new project structure, use the following command:

```bash
strct <structure_type> [destination_path]
```

- `<structure_type>`: The name of the template you want to use.
- `[destination_path]`: Optional. The path where you want to create the project. If not specified, the current directory will be used.

Example:
```bash
strct python-flask my_new_project
```

This command will create a new Flask project structure in a directory called `my_new_project`.

### Listing Available Templates

To see all available templates, use:

```bash
strct list
```

This will display a list of all templates you can use to create project structures.

### Adding a New Template

To add a new template based on an existing project structure:

```bash
strct add <template_name> <source_path>
```

- `<template_name>`: The name you want to give to your new template.
- `<source_path>`: The path to the existing project structure you want to use as a template.

Example:
```bash
strct add my-react-template ./existing-react-project
```

### Deleting a Template

To remove a template:

```bash
strct delete <template_name>
```

This will permanently remove the specified template.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Template Selection**: Choose from predefined or custom project templates.
2. **Structure Creation**: STRCT generates the directory structure and files based on the selected template.
3. **Customization**: Easily modify the created structure to fit your specific needs.
4. **Reusability**: Save time on future projects by reusing your templates.
